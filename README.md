## The challenge 

Create a program to determine the understanding of Natural Language processing and machine learning skills. Handson experience on Jupyter Notebook code.

### Overview

In this project, we have used NLP for predicting the emotions based on the message entered by the user. It predicts 6 emotions as follows: sadness, love, anger, joy, fear and surprise.

## My process

- You can save your model in .pkl file, which can be integrated in other webapps or mobile applications.
- Below is the link for .pkl file for trained model.

### Useful resources

- [Text Message dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/emotion-dataset) 
- [Fastai Documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/) - This helped me for understanding all concepts of fastai library. This is the top of my list for machine learning development.
